Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass. Python has a built-in module called unittest that provides a framework for writing and running tests1. There are also third-party frameworks such as pytest that provide additional features and a more concise syntax for writing tests2. You can use test doubles to decouple production code from the rest of the system to be tested in isolation3. Udemy offers a course on how to implement unit tests in Python using the discipline of Test Driven Development4.
