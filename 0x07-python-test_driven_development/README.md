 Test-driven development (TDD) in Python is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The TDD process typically follows these steps:

1. **Write a Test:** A developer writes a test that defines the desired behavior of a feature or a unit of code. In Python, this test is often created using testing frameworks such as unittest, pytest, or nose.

2. **Run the Test:** The test is run and expected to fail initially, as the corresponding code to pass the test has not been implemented yet.

3. **Write Code:** The developer writes the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test. This code may include new functionality or modifications to existing code.

4. **Run the Test Suite:** The entire test suite, including the new test, is run to ensure that the changes made did not break any existing functionality.

5. **Refactor Code:** If necessary, the developer refactors the code to improve its structure, readability, or performance, while ensuring that all tests continue to pass.

6. **Repeat:** Steps 1-5 are repeated for each new feature or unit of code.

Python is well-suited to TDD due to its support for various testing frameworks and libraries, along with its simplicity and readability, which makes it easier to write and maintain test cases.

By following TDD practices in Python, developers can create tests that serve as executable documentation and provide confidence that code changes do not inadvertently introduce bugs. This approach often leads to cleaner, more maintainable code and a more robust software system.
